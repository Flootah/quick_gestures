# QuickGestures

A tool for practicing gesture drawings on the go.

QuickGestures is a tool for artists to use their own image collections to practice figure drawing and gesture drawings in quick timed sessions, without the need to attend a professional art class or hire a live model.

Benefits:
Practicing gesture drawings is considered essential practice for art fundamentals and can help facilitate the study of the human figure in motion, and is especially important for artists who want to draw characters or animate.

Ease of Use:
Choose a folder of images in your device, and QuickGestures will scan for all images within it. Then, select the session type that fits you, and you can start drawing! 

Available session types:
• Interval: All images will have the same time limit (10 seconds to 10 minutes).
• Class: 1-hour session with intervals that mimic an art class (images start at 30 seconds then become as long as 10 minutes).
• Relaxed: No timer! Draw images at your own pace, and choose when to start the next one.
***COMING SOON*** • Custom: Create and save your own custom sessions.
